# JWST_Simulation
Three novel python files are included which simulate the JWST deep field image. 
The deterministic simulation generates a deep field image from one set of 
initial conditions defined in the code's control panel. The second code
runs the deterministic simulation as an ensemble and outputs the average
galaxy coverage percentage from averaging the ensemble members. The third
code generates a monochrome deep field image as a more-realistic 
representation of what the JWST deep field image will look like by 
incorporation Tolman Dimming. Comments are included throughout the code
to describe what each line of code is doing. The results of the study
conducted with these codes will be submitted for publication. Simply 
download the python modules, adjust the initial conditions as desired in
the control panel, ensure the required modules are installed, and run the
code.
